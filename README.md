# Professional page made without frameworks

This project has been done for practice purposes, since I've a strong backend profile and I want to make sure I'm profficient enough to handle a simple project without CSS frameworks such as Bootstrap.

With that being said, this project has the following tech stack:
- Plain HTML
- Plain Javascript (almost no Javascript TBH, since it wasn't necessary)
- SCSS (Used a VS Code extension called Live Sass)

In addition, this project is being deployed using Netlify, you can check the results here: https://lluishernandez.netlify.com/

Any constructive criticism is well recieved.
